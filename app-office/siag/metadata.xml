    Siag is an old-school office package that needs only some X11 libs. It
	doesn't rely on modern graphical toolkits like gtk+ or Qt, so it is well
	suited for old, less capable hardware. You should be aware, though, that it
	is unmaintained, and it may compile just fine, but it might not run. The
	modern X11 software stack has simply passed Siag by, so the way Siag wants
	to do things may not work on your system.
