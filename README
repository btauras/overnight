This overlay contains random ebuilds written, adapted, or otherwise hacked up by
me. I usually code stuff here, then sent it to Gentoo's Bugzilla for eventual
inclusion into Portage.

Note that not everything in here may compile, or if it does, it may not install.
I've tried to always keep it in a working state, but if something fails, do let
me know. Fixes are gratefully accepted.
