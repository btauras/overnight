This overlay contains random ebuilds written, adapted, or otherwise hacked up by
me. I usually code stuff here, then send it to Gentoo's Bugzilla for eventual
inclusion into Portage.

I try to keep the overlay in a working state, but if something fails, do let me
know. Fixes are gratefully accepted. A lot of the packages in here are related
to audio/visual creation. These things have to be kept functional at all times,
so you should be in good shape, whatever you decide to use.
