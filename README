This overlay contains random ebuilds written, adapted, or otherwise hacked up by
me. I usually code stuff here, then send it to Gentoo's Bugzilla for eventual
inclusion into Portage.

Note that not everything in here may compile, or if it does, it may not run
correctly. I try to keep the overlay in a working state, but if something
fails, do let me know. Fixes are gratefully accepted.
